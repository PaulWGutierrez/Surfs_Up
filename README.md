# Surfs Up Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
#### The purpose of this analysis is to see if Oahu, Hawaii is a good location to start a surfing shake shop business. One of the main tasks is to do some research and run some analytics on a weather dataset for the island of Oahu. Within the research, as well as trying to get investors to help start off the business one investor named W. Avy is interested. Not only is he interested, he has had experience running a surf shop which turned out to be unsuccessful due to the weather. W. Avy wants analytics of Oahu weather dataset to be ran before moving forward with investing in the business.

## Results 
### Three major points from the two analysis:
- #### - There is no major difference in average temperature for June and December; closely to 4 degrees in difference
- #### - The June temperatures seem to be closely similar throughout the month and a lower standard deviation 
- #### - The December temperatures are high, but not as close throughout the month like June; one point that indicates this observation is by the standard deviation

## Summary
#### A high-level summary of the results would be in June or mainly in the summer time there should be more activity and traffic from customers to explore the shop. For December the temperature would be high, but not as consistent as June. Meaning there should be some marketing strategy for that month, mainly winter season to promote the shop to have a similar business traffic like June. Two additional queries that I would perform to gather more weather data would be a query to inform where would be the best location to place a shop or shops within the island, and the other query to perform would be for the percipitation data which is highly important due to the percipitation causing a possible drastic effect of the costumer presence in the surfing shake shop.
